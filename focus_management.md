# Focus Management

## Question 1: What is Deep Work?

Deep Work, as defined by Cal Newport, is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It involves activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.


## Question 2: According to the author, how to do deep work properly?

To do deep work properly, Cal Newport suggests:

1. **Work deeply** – Schedule time blocks for focused work without interruptions.
2. **Embrace boredom** – Train your brain to be okay with boredom and avoid switching tasks frequently.
3. **Quit social media** – Be selective and intentional about your use of social media.
4. **Drain the shallows** – Minimize low-value shallow work like unnecessary meetings and emails.


## Question 3: How can you implement the principles in your day-to-day life?


- **Time Blocking:** Set specific periods in your day dedicated to deep work.
- **Digital Detox:** Reduce social media and notifications during work hours.
- **Mindful Breaks:** Alternate between deep work sessions and diffused mode activities like walking or meditating.
- **Prioritize Tasks:** Focus on high-impact tasks and reduce time spent on shallow work.

## Question 4: What are the dangers of social media, in brief?


- **Constant distraction** – Social media fragments attention and reduces the ability to concentrate.
- **Addictive design** – Platforms are built to keep users hooked, often at the cost of productivity.
- **Reduced depth** – The habit of fast scrolling diminishes deep thinking and reading capacity.
- **Anxiety & comparison** – Leads to negative emotions from constant comparison and information overload.
